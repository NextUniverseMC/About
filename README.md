# About
As part of NextUniverse's goal of being a different server in the community, we are open sourcing *all* of our custom plugins.
This mostly focuses on backend, but it may include custom minigames.

Most plugins are made by @TheDiamondPicks, plugins by other authors will include atribution. Compiled versions will never be provided, while we want to be as open as possible, we don't want to encourage rip-offs of our server, rather we want to encourage developers to edit and contribute.

## Pull Requests & Issues
Feel free to make a pull request or submit an issue, likely changes will make it onto the live server. You will be added to an attribution list in the case of pull requests.
